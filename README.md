# Abstract of the Article

# How to regenerate Figure 3?
1. Create two empty folders at the same directory as the codes and name them "**Networks**" and "**Data**" respectively. These two folders are used to store trained networks and necessary data that will be used to evaluate the performance.
2. Open the file `main.m` and execute it.
3. When
